### 1. **Make an Account**

In order to make a account go to [OpenAI.com.](https://openai.com/)

### 2. **Open the Playground**

After you make an account open up the playground.

### 3. **Choose a Model**

Once you open the playground you can select a model you want to use by clicking a dropdown meny at the top of the screen. You will see two options **GPT-3** and **GPT-4**(GPT-4 is better and newer).

### 4. **Typing Prompts and Check the AI Answers**

Once you select the version you like you are good to go to ask whatever you like to the AI. Once you ask or say something to it you will get an answer. Don't like what it said tweak your previous reponse or question to be more specific on what you are looking for.
